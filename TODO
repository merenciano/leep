    - Change std::string with fixed size char arrays where convenient (entity names for example, with 32 len)
    - Redo the version and gpu version of gpu resources
    - Per frame allocator to be used in std::containers
    - Better gpu resource deletion
    - Time comparisons with raspberry pi and governor at powresave (document that)
    - Pause and next frame button



    - Displaylist hard to debug because things happen later and its hard to keep track of which command is
